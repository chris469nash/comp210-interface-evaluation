									<h2 class="major">Methodology
									</h2>
									<p>In order to gather my findings/data I did as followed: I asked 10 people, both male and female, both with and without gaming experience to play the first level of the 3rd year game, 'Oh s*^t wormhole!'. Once they had completed the first level of the game I asked them to navigate around the menus and then finally complete a questionnaire I had made for them to fill out about their experience playing the game and how they found the user interface.
