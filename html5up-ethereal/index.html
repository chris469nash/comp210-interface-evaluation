									<p>I have conducted a questionnaire to 10 people, both male and female, with and without previous gaming experience over a range of different ages. Throughout this website I will share my findings and will also discuss the data I have received as well as giving my conclusion on the results.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Methodology
									</h2>
									<p>In order to gather my findings/data I did as followed: I asked 10 people, both male and female, both with and without gaming experience to play the first level of the 3rd year game, 'Oh s*^t wormhole!'. Once they had completed the first level of the game I asked them to navigate around the menus and then finally complete a questionnaire I had made for them to fill out about their experience playing the game and how they found the user interface followed up with a discussion of their answers to the questions and their reasons for doing so.

									<p>Qualitative results:
Immersion:
From the first four questions that were designed to be qualitative questions to provide accurate results on any issues the user may have found throughout the game appear to all follow a strong correlation of results. It appears that the first question, (as seen on the results section of this website) the majority of the users didn’t feel immersed within the gameplay at all. Upon further discussion within the users, they felt like it wasn’t realistic enough. One user felt that they were in-fact immersed throughout the entire time they were playing the game, they added that they enjoy the wackiness of the game and prefer unrealistic games to hyper-realistic.</br> 

Rewarding the player:
Question number two appears to be a tad more divided than some of the other results collected from the questionnaire. Six users believed that the game wasn’t rewarding them in any way throughout their gameplay. Upon discussion about this after they had completed the questionnaire they had all said that they don’t feel like the game was rewarding at all, they didn’t receive any power-ups or benefits at all. The remaining four users had said they felt the game was rewarding to an extent, they had received checkpoints throughout their gameplay and felt this was a sufficient reward for the user.</br>

									<p>Qualitative results:
Instructions:
This question had received an expected one-sided response with a total of seven users saying the instructions were clear whilst the remaining three users had said they weren’t clear and could be added upon in further depth. A few of the seven whom had voted ‘yes’ also added that although they understood the instructions, they could be added upon in further depth also.</br>

Game menu:
Question number four resulted in a split between the ten users. A total of 50% liked and were satisfied with the menus within the game whilst the remaining 50% didn’t like them at all. Some users also added that in order to pause the game whilst within a level they pressed escape to freeze the time but found no real to exit the game. Upon further investigation they had claimed that they would press escape in order to press the pause button located within the top left-hand of the screen but encountered an issue. They would press the button but nothing would happen other than the game resuming, this meant they had to press it again and they found this to be a slight annoyance and thought it may have been a bug within the game.</br>

									<p>Quantitative results:
									Goal of the game:
This question resulted in a spread of answers resulting in no precise and clear answer as to why. Upon discussion with a few users afterwards, they had said that the goal of the game was clear once they had started the level but there was no indication of what the purpose was of the game.</br> 

Narrative:
The results for question number six resulted in a clear response to the question, with all users voting that the narrative of the game was much lower than expected. Discussion with a few of the users had cleared this up somewhat, they had said that the games narrative was in very little or they felt nothing at all. They would have much rather have had a more narrative story-driven gameplay than what they had received. They felt confused about the gameplay itself and felt like a stronger narrative would have cleared that up for them a lot more.</br>

									<p>Quantitative results:
									Controls:
Again, the user’s answers to this question were also spread across the scale of answers they could choose from. Most of the users had felt like the controls were easy to use the character was just following the mouse movement itself. Other users felt like the controls could have been better but upon further discussion about how they feel like they could be improved they had said they aren’t sure how they could be improved.</br>

Difficulty:
The final question had given a mix of results but had also given a definite result of that the users had found the game hard rather than too easy. The majority of the users found the game to be too hard rather than challenging. Upon observation most of the users had completed the first level with a few difficulties but found this exciting and required their full attention to complete the level. Other users had said they found the game challenging but not hard enough. They had claimed there could be different pathways they could take throughout the level which may lead to dead ends to further the difficulty of the game.</br>

									<h2 class="major">Conclusion</h2>
									<p>In conclusion, it is clear to see that the majority of the users didn’t like the game’s UI as a whole and this may mean that they may never play the game again. There are some serious and valid issues brought up by the users throughout the questionnaire and discussion we had had after their gameplay.</br> I had asked the users that scored the game highly throughout the questionnaire if they would play the game again. Each user had said they would play the game again but wish to see some improvements within the difficulty and also some form of improved controls as well as improved indications of when the player has clicked a button.</br> It would appear that the game as a whole has some definite improvements that need attention but it doesn’t entirely put off their player base very much.
